Recently, Manuel Pais, co-author of *Team Topologies*, used my company as an example of something we’ve both called **Leadership as a Platform**. You can see us mentioned [here](<>).

I've been deeply involved in shifting how we see ourselves—as a **platform**—and ensuring we maintain that perspective. Instead of treating leadership as a position or a set of management tasks, we emphasize that **anyone** can take leadership. It’s about stepping up, driving alignment, and enabling others to succeed.

To make this work, we’ve built a dedicated team focused on **alignment and leadership as a platform**—which we call **Team Alignment**. Their mission is to provide services that empower our teams and individuals to take the lead while keeping the organization aligned. They cover many of the tasks of a traditional top management group.

## Our approach

* **Service-Oriented Leadership:** We view leadership activities as **services**, not just tasks. This ensures that all necessary information is accessible and that teams are effectively onboarded into our strategic direction.
* **Team Responsibility:** Leadership and alignment are collective responsibilities rather than being solely on the shoulders of managers. This fosters a more collaborative and engaged environment.

This approach helps us maintain cohesive strategy, ensuring that everyone at Capra remains aligned and informed.
