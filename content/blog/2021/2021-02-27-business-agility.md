As agile methods for software development has been quite widely adopted, and it is great. It has been hard, but now it seems widely accepted that smaller iterations and getting user feedback fast, is crucial in software development. It builds better software, and better products. It also recognized how both product and software development are complex problems [^1], where the solution will be emerging over time,not defined up front. It will also be improved over time, through discovery. Might this also be applicable to business as a whole?

It seems 
Seeing this trend, 

Setting out to find out what is meant with 'business agility', I of course did a search. This is what I found:

> Business agility is concerned with the adoption and evolution of values, behaviours and capabilities. These enable businesses and individuals to be more adaptive, creative and resilient when dealing with complexity, uncertainty and change leading to improved well-being and better outcomes. [^2]

 So, how might business 

 ### Agil
Through my own work, and what I've heard from others, I have recognized some patters 

 1. Treating parts of the business as a delivery machine, e.g. software development ("build this product") or marketing ("market this product"), and calling the business agile as there is some autonomy in execution
 2. 


 ### What enables us to solve complex problems?
 To build "business agility", I argue that one must build an organizations capability to solve problems, more importantly complex ones. Most problems will be:

 > Most situations and decisions in organizations are complex because some major change—a bad quarter, a shift in management, a merger or acquisition—introduces unpredictability and flux. In this domain, we can understand why things happen only in retrospect. (Snowden and Boone, [here](https://hbr.org/2007/11/a-leaders-framework-for-decision-making))
 
 Snowden and Boone writes about this type of problems to adress how a leader might apporach them. As autonomy increases, more decisions are done everywhere in the organization. I.e. more problems are solved further "down" in the hierarchy. How does not one approach such problems, and make the solution as good as it can? An example approach can be found [here](https://txm.com/making-sense-problems-cynefin-framework/). It reads:

1. Explore to learn about the problem, as they require more creativity and innovative thinking skills
2. Develop a theory and experiment to gather more knowledge
3. Experimentation to discover patterns and gain more knowledge
4. Repeat as necessary, with the goal of moving your problem into another category
5. Execute and evaluate, following the Plan, Do, Check, Act cycle

The premise here is that you ar e able to explore the problem thinking cratlively about it. You must develop theories and experiment. How might an organizatino best enable all teams to do those things? 

 ### Real Cross-Functional Teams

About cross-functional teams not only being about devops, frontend/backend, infrastructure etc, but enabling the team to 
1. Develop the product, including building the tech and UX, and data pipelines to improve it
2. Develop the product strategy, including selecting the next feature to build, users to build for, how to spend time and not spent time
3. And building the market strategy
4. .. And propably many other things that I with my background cannot even think of. And that is sort of my point.


Bring in referneces etc.

 ### Closing notes
The recipe for building business agility seems to be the same as for building software agility. One could even argue that they are the exact same thing. Why then, do businesses only place a "reprresenative for the business" as a Product Owner in the development team, instead of bringing  the developers together with a thorough understanding of the product and market? Building organizations without silos is hard. [^3] Does that mean we should not try, or try harder?
