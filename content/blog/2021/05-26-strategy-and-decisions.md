At the yearly conference of my company (this year held digitally in April), I held talk on how strategy is about making decisions. In short, I argue that to be able to continously deliver business value, one must enable all parts of the organization to amke small, incremental decisions that align. I.e. avoid big bang decisions, as well as big bang releases. 

In short, I have four suggestions to make smaller and faster decisions:

1. Build accountable teams, with full responsibilitiy for a business area
2. Define interefaces between teams, inlcuding decision prosesses
3. Build platforms that teams and individuals can build on: Both technical platforms but also business platforms. Enable your people to make decisons that align, not just expect them to! This might include an updated company strategy, or simply the the general requirements for a vendor.
4. Be transparent! Make sure that everyone knows what each team is working on, and why. Why and how they make their decisions. And if a bigger decision really is needed, make sure the process for it well defined and transparent.

The talk is in Norwegian, and can be seen below.  Slides may be read [here](/CC21.pdf)
