Lately, I've felt the need to clarify the distinction between enabling and platform teams in the book ["Team Topologies: Organizing Business and Technology Teams for Fast Flow"](https://www.amazon.com/Team-Topologies-Organizing-Business-Technology/dp/1942788819). The reason for this, is that platform teams often must consult on more than what their platform is dedicated to do. That might not be the best for that team, but it might be what the organization needs. HOw can we address that need directly?

## Definitions of enabling and platform teams

First, look at the enabling team:

> The primary purpose of an enabling team is to help stream-aligned teams deliver working software in a sustainable, responsible way. Enabling teams do not exist to fix problems that arise from poor practices, poor prioritization choices, or poor code quality within stream-aligned teams. Stream-aligned teams should expect to work with enabling teams only for short periods of time (weeks or months) in order to increase their capabilities around a new technology, concept, or approach. After the new skills and understanding have been embedded in the stream-aligned team, the enabling team will stop daily interaction with the stream-aligned team, switching their focus to a different team.

What's the role of the platform team?

> The platform team provides internal services to reduce the cognitive load that would be required from stream-aligned teams to develop these underlying services.

The authors refer to the Jutta Eckstein article from 2014, ["Architecture in Large Scale Agile Development"](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-14358-3_3). It offers us this figure showing various ways of handling architecture needs:

## Handling the need for consulting

So, your platform team should not do consulting. How might you handle it?

A few practices that might work, based on the number of people you have in your platform team, and the need for consulting around your organization:

1. Create a dedicated enabling team for consulting on the platform
2. Dedicate a few people on the team to consult, and rotate who does it

This means that a platform team might do consulting. If that  consulting is a small group
