description: Some try to construct a "battle" between agile and product-mindset.
  I do not believe that there is any contradiction between the two.

A recent [event](https://www.meetup.com/smidig/events/295796327) I was considering visiting, was advertising that there was supposed to be discussion there on product vs. agile., as these were somewhat on a collision course. I do not agree with the premise at all, and I've thought about the relation. 

Product is about what to build, i.e. something that hits a need.
Agile is about delivering continously, and being able to respond to changes.

A company can be agile but not be product-minded.
And a company can likewise be product-minded but not agile in how they deliver it. 

To combine the two means
1. Being organized for flow into product teams that have what they need to deliver 
2. Have effective prioritzation that does not isolate Time-To-Market-calculations to  development teams, but rather a organization wide effort
3. Utilize Product Discovery Habits and building product-market fit

The product-mindset comes into play in the product teams. It can also happen in dedicated business development departments or teams, as long as those are viewed as a part of a complete value chain for the company.
