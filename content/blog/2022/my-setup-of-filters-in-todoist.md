I'm a big fan of [Todoist](www.todoist.com), and recently a colleague asked me about my setup, Here's an overview:

* One project per context, where I have two main projects: Work and Personal
* Each project has two sections: Do Now and Backlog
* This enables me to have the following useful filters:
  * Overdue first, then inbox, then all work items for today, and finally all personal items for today: `overdue, #Inbox, (##Work & today), (##Personal & today)`
  * Do Now or Backlog for a context: `(##Work ) & /Do Now` or `(##Work ) & /Backlog`, and similarly with `##Personal`

In addition, I have a separate main project for agendas with people, i.e. things I want to talk about with person X.
