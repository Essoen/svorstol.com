# Book notes on Rethinking Agile

I recently read the book [Rethinking Agile: Why Agile Teams Have Nothing To Do With Business Agility](\[https://www.amazon.com/Rethinking-Agile-Nothing-Business-Agility/dp/3903205397), and many of the ideas and concepts resonated with me. Usually, I take notes in a Miro-board, but this time I also want to share some notes here, as it might be useful to others.

## Part 1: The Problem

The book

## Part 2: Causes

The book describes four possible causes of the problem, each in its own section. Here's a brief summary of each:

1. **The pitfall of simplistic inference in the change process:** When companies want optimized Time-To-Market (TTM) and faster customer feedback, they tend to believe that agile is a concrete step to reach that goal. So they introduce a big agile transformation project. They reorganize, introduce new roles, and describe what these roles are allowed to do. Leopold argues that this will draw focus to roles, responsibilities, and processes, rather than how to actually increase TTM and customer feedback. They confuse "means for the purpose". He also notes that your organizational model does not make you agile either. not. "Success depends on answering one question: How do we make our money and which problem are we trying to solve?" ^[1]
2. **Dealing with dependencies between Teams and Products:**  
3. **An incomplete value stream:** 
4. **WIP Limits at the wrong place:** 

## Part 3: Flight Levels

Klaus argues that to achieve visibility and coordination as to mitigate the problem and causes, one must establish visibility and coordination arenas at three levels:

1. Operational Level
2. Co-ordinational Level
3. Strategic Portfolio Management

Every organization is different, but I'd translate this to:

1. Implementational level, e.g. development teams
2. Middle management, i.e. leaders of various business areas
3. Executive level, i.e. the leaders responsible for setting the course and deciding on the future of the company as a whole

My experience is that most organizations would implement agility in the teams, while not on the other business areas. tjhi

> Business agility doesn't work if an organization is comprised of agile islands while the logic of the surrounding processes remains the same and certain groups exempt themselves from practicing agility.

> The decision to "work without a hierarchy" has to be decided by someoneâ€”presumably it isn't the building maintenance person making this decision.
