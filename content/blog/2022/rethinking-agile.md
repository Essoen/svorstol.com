# Book notes on Rethinking Agile

I recently read the book [Rethinking Agile: Why Agile Teams Have Nothing To Do With Business Agility]([https://www.amazon.com/Rethinking-Agile-Nothing-Business-Agility/dp/3903205397), and many of the ideas and concepts resonated with me. Usually, I take notes in a Miro-board, but this time I also want to sahre some notes here.

## Part 1: The Problem

## Part 2: Causes 



## Part 3: Flight Levels


1. Operational Level
2. Coordinational
3. Strategic Portfolio Management

> Business agility doesn't work if an organization is comprised of agile islands while the logic of the surrounding processes remains the same and certain groups exempt themselves from practicing agility.
