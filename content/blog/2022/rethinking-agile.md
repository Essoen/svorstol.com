# Book notes on Rethinking Agile

I recently read the book [Rethinking Agile: Why Agile Teams Have Nothing To Do With Business Agility](\[https://www.amazon.com/Rethinking-Agile-Nothing-Business-Agility/dp/3903205397), and many of the ideas and concepts resonated with me. Usually, I take notes in a Miro-board, but this time I also want to share some notes here.

## Part 1: The Problem

## Part 2: Causes

## Part 3: Flight Levels

Klaus argues that to achieve visibility and coordination as to mitigate the problem and causes, one must establish visibility and coordination arenas at three levels:

1. Operational Level
2. Co-ordinational Level
3. Strategic Portfolio Management 

Every organization is different, but I'd translate this to:

1. Implementational level, e.g. development teams
2. Middle management, i.e. leaders of various business areas
3. Executive level, i.e. the leaders responsible for setting the course and deciding on the future of the company as a whole

My experience is that most organizations would implement agility in the teams, while not on the other business areas. tjhi

> The decision to "work without a hierarchy" has to be decided by someoneâ€”presumably it isn't the building maintenance person making this decision.
