_Fast flow_ is delivering often, and delivering on customer demand. How do we know that we are? Accelerate found that the so called DORA-metrics can predict 2x better results in the following area:

1. Profitability
2. Productivity
3. Market share
4. Number of customers

The [DORA-metrics](https://www.leanix.net/en/wiki/vsm/dora-metrics#what-are-DORA-metrics) are

1. Lead time
2. Deployment frequency
3. Mean time to restore
4. Change/fail percentage

So, it seems that we can measure our technical ability to deliver often and with quality, improves Time-To-Market (TTM) and cycle time

How might we help our teams to focus on those metrics?

1. Reduce cognitive load ^[1]
2. Reduce handovers ^[2]

And what would that mean in practice? 

1. Organize based on domains
2. [Help teams coordinate](https://www.svorstol.com/blog/2022/rethinking-agile/)
3. Nurture a culture where improvement is celebrated, i.e. implement changes that help us deliver faster and with less faults
4. Communicate direction and context often, e.g. with tools such as [OKRs](https://www.svorstol.com/blog/2022/okrs-when-scaling/)
