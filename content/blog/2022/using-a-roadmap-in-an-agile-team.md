# Roadmaps in an agile context

A colleague and I discussed 

I hadn't read the book myself, but I went through the chapters on roadmaps

> The issue is that anytime you put a list of ideas on a document entitled “roadmap,” no matter how many disclaimers you put on it, people across the company will interpret the items as a commitment.

It should give someone looking at it an idea of:

1. What are we working on right now, and why
2. Clues as to what problems are going to be addressed in the next iteration/time-box
3. And when that iteration/time-box is

This does not have to be as rigid and difficult as one might associate with a roadmap in a traditional sense. A list of "doing now" and "up next", with some business context for each item, might do the trick if stakeholders have a product-oriented understanding and mindset.

For this to work, the roadmap must be:

1. Updated continuously
2. Approved/get buy-in regularly

And I'd say the "approval cadence" should be at least once a month.
