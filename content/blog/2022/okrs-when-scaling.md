I recently held a short talk on OKRs, and how their usage develops over time when used in a scaling organization. Here's a short summary of the talk, which was in Norwegian. The original slide deck can be found [here](2022/cc22.pdf). Here's a short summary in English.

So, the starting point here is that I saw a recently released old interview with Steve Jobs in which he talks about how Apple is organized. He says that he has one person responsible for each area and that the teamwork between these people at the top will spread to the rest of the company. The prerequisite for this to work, he says, is trust.

> \[..\] and teamwork is dependent on trusting the other folks to come through with their part, without watching them all the time.   
> \- [Steve Jobs](https://youtu.be/f60dheI4ARg )

So this is obviously about culture, both within teams and in the organization as a whole. How might we build an organization where everyone trusts each other in delivering what's needed? That being said, despite trusting others we still might need to know what others are focusing on, and how that's going. In short, we all want to know:

1. What's the main focus within my own team?
2. What's the focus of other teams?
3. Are what we and other teams are focusing on aligned so that we are going in one direction?
4. How are we all moving along in that direction?

This is where management by objective with a model such as OKRs might be useful. It can be traced back to the 1950s with Peter Drucker's book "Management by Objective" His point was that you get more engagement and higher performance when employees and leaders set goals together. Later he made it clear that this is a tool, and it really doesn't make it easier to set the goals themselves. Nevertheless: In 1974 Andy Grove implemented MBO at Intel when he was CEO there. He established it as OKRs -  Objectives and Key Results. John Doerr brought it to Goole around 1999 and wrote the book Measure What Matters which was released in 2018. This brought OKRs into companies in Silicon Valley, and over the last 2-3 years Norway as well.

## What's the model about?

Objectives and Key Results

* Objective – et ambisiøst, tidsbestemt og kvalitativt mål
* Key Results – hvordan vi måler at vi når målet

I tillegg er det ofte nyttig å legge til

* Initiativer – de konkrete tiltakene vi setter i gang for å skape ønsket bevegelse. Enten som oppgaver i JIRA, eller et prosjekt i en porteføljeoversikt.

So, why would you use OKRs?

Drucker nevnte for MBO at det skaper engasjement og motivasjon. Det er også hensikt med OKR. I tillegg

1. Det kan skape transparens i hva som er i fokus i enkeltteam og helhetlig, Noe som gjø at vi kan unngå å aktivt måtte spørre andre om hva de driver med, slik Steve ville unngå.
2. Øke forståelse for og sammenheng mellom overordnet strategi

This is how you'd usually implement OKRs:

1. Noen, som en ledergruppe, styre elle strategigruppe, kommuniserer en etablert strategi og kanskje noen mål med utgangspunkt i den
   1. Noen ord om bransjen, og virksomhetens forhold til den kanskje
   2. Utfordringer/problemer som må løses
   3. Noen policies/rammer for hvordan man skal håndtere de utfordringene
   4. Og kanskje til og med noen mer konkrete mål å strekke seg mot
2. Teamene etablerer sine mål med dette som kontekst
3. Ledere går i dialog med team man ser at ålene ikke matcher med strategi, eller det er et stort gap

## Heartbeat work vs. strategic work

In her excellent article called ["Not Everyone Needs Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)"](https://cwodtke.medium.com/not-everyone-needs-okrs-a198db0c7bc8) Christina Wodtke established the concept of _Heartbeat Work_.

## How use of OKRs changes as you scale

I praksis erfarer jeg selv at dette er vanskelig. Både i store og små organisasjoner.

Da er det jo åpenbart spennende å utforske årsakene.

Konkret er min erfaring at disse to tingene er problematisk for mange team:

1. Det de skal jobbe med, er ikke relevant for strategien/teamet opplever ikke at de skal levere på en strategi
2. Alt de skal levere på, passer ikke inn i en OKR
   1. «Men hva da med teknisk gjeld, skal vi ikke gjøre noe med det?»

## Advice on implementation

So, based on my experience, the following advice might be useful for teams and organizations that want to implement the OKR model:

1. Be clear on why you want to use OKRs in the first place. Hopefully, it's not just hype.
2. Connect OKRs directly to your strategy, i.e. make sure that Objectives are based on you strategy
3. Focus on what you can measure, instead of spending lots of time discussing whether it's the best measurement
4. Don't fret too much about the framework, instead focus on why and how it's useful to you and your company

Good luck!
