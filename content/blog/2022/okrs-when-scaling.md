I recently held a short talk on OKRs, and how their usage develops over time when used in a scaling organization. Here's a short summary of the talk, which was in Norwegian. The original slide deck can be found [here](/2022/cc22.pdf). Sadly, it wasn't recorded, but here's a short summary in English.

So, the starting point here is that I saw a recently released old interview with Steve Jobs in which he talks about how Apple is organized. He says that he has one person responsible for each area and that the teamwork between these people at the top will spread to the rest of the company. The prerequisite for this to work, he says, is trust.

> \- [Steve Jobs](https://youtu.be/f60dheI4ARg )

So this is obviously about culture, both within teams and in the organization as a whole. How might we build an organization where everyone trusts each other in delivering what's needed? That being said, despite trusting others we still might need to know what others are focusing on, and how that's going. In short, we all want to know:

1. What's the main focus within my own team?
2. What's the focus of other teams?
3. Are what we and other teams are focusing on aligned so that we are going in one direction?
4. How are we all moving along in that direction?

This is where management by objective with a model such as OKRs might be useful. It can be traced back to the 1950s with Peter Drucker's book "Management by Objective" His point was that you get more engagement and higher performance when employees and leaders set goals together. Later he made it clear that this is a tool, and it really doesn't make it easier to set the goals themselves. Nevertheless: In 1974 Andy Grove implemented MBO at Intel when he was CEO there. He established it as OKRs -  Objectives and Key Results. John Doerr brought it to Goole around 1999 and wrote the book Measure What Matters which was released in 2018. This brought OKRs into companies in Silicon Valley, and over the last 2-3 years Norway as well.

## What's the model about?

Objectives and Key Results consist of:

* Objective – an ambitious, qualitative, and time-bound goal
* Key Results – measurements for knowing if we've reached the goals

Read more [here](https://www.perdoo.com/okr-guide/). That reference mentions something that in my experience is always forgotten: Initiatives. Where the Objectives give direction, Key Results measures progression the initiatives are the concrete actions we take to get us there. This is usually tracked in portfolio management or JIRA tasks for teams. Initatives are the concrete actions that will deliver the results we want. One set of OKRs can have all its initiatives in one team or multiple initiatives across teams. Each team does not need its own OKRs.

This would be a sort of boilerplate for how to implement OKRs:

1. "Someone", such as a management group or board, communicates an established strategy. It might consist of:
   1. A description of the business the company is in
   2. The challenges/threats that the company has to overcome
   3. Some policies as to how those challenges are to be met
   4. And some high-level but quantified goals to reach for
2. Teams create their goals with that strategy as the context
3. Leaders meets with teams where they do not see how the goals match with the strategy

In my experience, the process becomes difficult because:

1. Missing strategy, in the one or more sense of the word "missing":
   1. There is really no strategy
   2. There is one, but it's too difficult to communicate
   3. It's not updated often enough, so it's not relevant to the business
   4. It's created in a waterfall manner, rather than [as a platform others can build upon](https://www.svorstol.com/blog/2021/05-26-strategy-and-decisions/)
2. The teams do not recognize themselves in the strategy, i.e. they cannot work on the goals they set based on the strategy because there's a delivery "they just have to deliver"
3. If it's not in the OKRs, the team thinks it's out of scope, e.g. technical debt.

This brings us to heartbeat work.

## Heartbeat work vs. strategic work

In her excellent article called ["Not Everyone Needs Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)"](https://cwodtke.medium.com/not-everyone-needs-okrs-a198db0c7bc8) Christina Wodtke established the concept of _Heartbeat Work_.

## How use of OKRs change as you scale

I praksis erfarer jeg selv at dette er vanskelig. Både i store og små organisasjoner.

Da er det jo åpenbart spennende å utforske årsakene.

Konkret er min erfaring at disse to tingene er problematisk for mange team:

1. **Strategic work:** Tracked with OKRs
2. **Continuous improvement work:** Kanban-boarsd, pipelines for improvement, roadmaps
3. **Heartbeat work:** Usually tracked with dashboards, metrics or kanban work. We just need this to _work_.

## Advice on implementation in your organization

So, based on my experience, the following advice might be useful for teams and organizations that want to implement the OKR model:

1. Be clear on why you want to use OKRs in the first place. Hopefully, it's not just hype.
2. Connect OKRs directly to your strategy, i.e. make sure that Objectives are based on your strategy
3. Focus on what you can measure, instead of spending lots of time discussing whether it's the best measurement
4. Don't fret too much about the framework, instead focus on why and how it's useful to you and your company

Good luck!
