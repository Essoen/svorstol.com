# How I work, an informational manual
_Version 1.0_

Over the last couple of years, I've seen people share "instruction manuals" for
themselves, shared through their personal websites. I recognize I'd value this
instructional/informational overview for my own manager, so I might as well
provide that for those who I manage, work with and report to. [This
article](https://www.remotecompany.com/blog/how-to-work-with-me-manual)
summarizes my motivations for doing this nicely, and a few of those that have
inspired me are [Isaac Hepworth](https://github.com/hepwori/wwi/) and [Den
Delimarsky](https://den.dev/how-i-work/).

Please note, this is a continuous work in progress, as I learn and improve. If
it doesn’t make sense, or doesn’t fit with your experience of me, please reach
out.

## Work Schedule

I usually work from around 8-9 to 16-17. A few days a week I might work longer
or get a few more hours in later in the evening. This might mean that you'll
receive messages or emails from me outside working hours. This does not mean I
expect an answer. You'll answer when you have time. If it's urgent, I'll call.
It's almost never that urgent.

## Communication

I prefer asynchronous communication via Slack, or the messaging tool preferred
where we work, over tools such as emails. I do not expect instant replies, even
during the regular workday. I like when my team uses open team Slack-channels to
ask questions, or talk about ideas, because I believe it empowers the whole
team.

[Inbox Zero](https://blog.doist.com/inbox-zero/) is great, and I follow it. But, most emails are not urgent, so I do not handle it as such. If you need a fast answer, call instead of e-mailing. Or call me after the email is sent. To me, an email can wait to be answered for two days. If not, one should tell the recipient about the urgency. 

To me, discussions fit better in Slack or a meeting, rather than email. Usually we have discussions over a particular decisions. It's easier to have these discussions if we write out the alternatives, the arguments for each of them, beforehand. This helps us get to the details, and where we disagree, faster. 

### Meetings

When calling for a meeting, I try to be clear on:

-   The goal of the meeting

-   What the ideal result of the meeting would be

-   An agenda, preferably with some time boxing

I love when the people I work with follow the same format, as I believe it makes
it easier to work and deliver value together.

It's worth mentioning that I appreciate that some meetings need to be more ad
hoc, and not as planned. It's nice to be clear on that need as well. This is
crucial in these times of hybrid work.

### Feedback

Feedback is highly appreciated. I love to continuously improve. It’s nice to
know what I’m doing well, but it’s even better when I’m told what to do
differently.

## Other notes
* Don't hesitate to reach out if you're blocked, or something's bothering you
* I enjoy to read, and discuss it. Maybe post some book notes and share. It's nice to get inspired by others experiences, and see if one can use something from them. To get the time for reading, and trying things out, [I book time in my calendar](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/time-blocking). The same goes for setting aside time to work on specific tasks.
* During vacations I am usually literally offline, i.e. I'm in the mountains with no coverage
* I find the [The Eisenhower matrix](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/eisenhower-matrix), and the [Impact/Effort-matrix ](https://miro.com/templates/impact-effort-matrix/) useful, and might refer to them a few times.
