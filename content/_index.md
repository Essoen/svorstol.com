I am Stein-Otto Svorst√∏l, an Engineering Manager & Agile Coach with a passion for building high-performing teams and
organizations. That means that my job is understanding the business, and coach and develop the all parts of the organization to deliver as much value as possible. Currently I work as a consultant for Capra Consulting in Oslo, Norway. Since April 2020 I've worked with NRK (Norwegian Broadcasting Service) on building high-performing empowered teams that build infrastructure and network solutions (i.e. the IT platform) for both developers and media systems/teams.

Outside work I enjoy hiking and other outdoorsy activites, reading books, gin, and spending unproportional amounts of time researching novelty devices.

Sometimes I [think about things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFZNvj-HfBU), and even write some thoughts down. Sometimes I publish those thoughts on my [blog](/blog).
