I am Stein-Otto, an Agile Coach/Teamlead/Engineering Manager with a passion for building high-performing teams and
organizations. In particular I enjoy working on digital products, in product orientet organizations. Currently I work as a consultant for Capra Consulting in Oslo, Norway. Since April 2020 I've worked with NRK (Norwegian Broadcasting Service) on building high-performing empowered teams that build infrastructure and network solutions for both developers and media systems/teams.

Outside work I enjoy hiking and other outdoorsy activites, reading books, gin, and spending unproportional amounts of time researching novelty devices.

Sometimes I write stuff, and sometimes I publish it here.
