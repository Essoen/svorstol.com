I do not agree with the premise at all, and I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about the relation.
Product is about what to build, i.e. something that hits a need. Agile is about delivering continously, and being able to respond to changes fast. It was a response to waterfall and plan-based development.</description></item><item><title>Summary of "Rethinking Agile: Why Agile Teams Have Nothing To Do With Business Agility"</title><link>https://www.svorstol.com/blog/2022/rethinking-agile/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jul 2022 12:00:39 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.svorstol.com/blog/2022/rethinking-agile/</guid><description>Updated September 27 2023
I recently read the book Rethinking Agile: Why Agile Teams Have Nothing To Do With Business Agility. I found it useful, and many of the ideas and concepts resonated with me. Usually, I take notes in a Miro-board while I read, but this time I also want to share some notes here, as it might be useful to others. Please note that these are my own notes, so it might be things that I&amp;rsquo;ve missed, or left out.</description></item><item><title>Communication and Education in an Agile Transition</title><link>https://www.svorstol.com/blog/2022/communication-and-education-in-an-agile-transition/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2022 17:49:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.svorstol.com/blog/2022/communication-and-education-in-an-agile-transition/</guid><description>This week I am attending the ICP-CAT course. One of the assignments was regarding how to use education and communication in an agile transition. One of the discussions sparked my interest, and I thought more about it after the course. This brought me to a model of how I&amp;rsquo;d address the need for communication and education, that might be useful for others as well.

It has been hard, but it is now quite widely accepted that smaller iterations and getting user feedback fast, is crucial to building software that covers actual needs. This means better software, and better products. This trend means that we are starting to recognize that both product and software development are in of itself are complex problems 1, where the solution will be emerging over time.</description></item></channel></rss>
