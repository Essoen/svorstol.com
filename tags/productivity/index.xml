I picked it after some extensive research after Wunderlist was bought by Microsoft. Recently a colleague asked me about my setup, Here&amp;rsquo;s a short overview:
I have one project per context, where I have two main projects: Work and Personal Each project has two sections: Do Now and Backlog This enables me to have the following really useful filters: Overdue first, then inbox, then all work items for today, and finally all personal items for today: overdue, #Inbox, (##Work &amp;amp; today), (##Personal &amp;amp; today) Do Now or Backlog for a context: (##Work ) &amp;amp; /Do Now or (##Work ) &amp;amp; /Backlog, and similarly with ##Personal See here for more on how filters work in Todoist.</description></item></channel></rss>
