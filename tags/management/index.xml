Most business want to use them for creating focus, tracking if initiatives to decide if they hit on desired outcomes, as well as creating alignment in the organisation. Not only for new initiatives, but across the business. By some, it seems to be looked at as a silver bullet for tracking work. In my experience, OKRs are not suitable for everyone and everything. Being clear on when and how you use them, is far more important than being able to say that one uses them in marketing.</description></item><item><title>How I Work</title><link>https://www.svorstol.com/work/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 00:10:34 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.svorstol.com/work/</guid><description>How I work, an informational manual Over the last couple of years, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen people share &amp;ldquo;instruction manuals&amp;rdquo; for themselves, shared through their personal websites. I recognize I&amp;rsquo;d value this instructional/informational overview for my own manager, so I might as well provide that for those who I manage, work with and report to. This article summarizes my motivations for doing this nicely, and a few of those that have inspired me are Isaac Hepworth and Den Delimarsky.</description></item></channel></rss>
