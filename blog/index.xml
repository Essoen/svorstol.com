Most business want to use them for creating focus, tracking if initiatives to decide if they hit on desired outcomes, as well as creating alignment in the organisation. Not only for new initiatives, but across the business. By some, it seems to be looked at as a silver bullet for tracking work. In my experience, OKRs are not suitable for everyone and everything. Being clear on when and how you use them, is far more important than being able to say that one uses them in marketing.</description></item><item><title>Making decisions often for increased flow everywhere in your organization</title><link>https://www.svorstol.com/blog/2021/05-26-strategy-and-decisions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 May 2021 10:39:47 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.svorstol.com/blog/2021/05-26-strategy-and-decisions/</guid><description>At the yearly conference of my company (this year held digitally in April), I held talk on how strategy is about making decisions. In short, I argue that to be able to continously deliver business value, one must enable all parts of the organization to amke small, incremental decisions that align. I.e. avoid big bang decisions, as well as big bang releases.

It has been hard, but it is now quite widely accepted that smaller iterations and getting user feedback fast, is crucial to building software that covers actual needs. This means better software, and better products. This trend means that we are starting to recognize that both product and software development are in of itself are complex problems 1, where the solution will be emerging over time.</description></item><item><title>Using Team Topologies to reorganize a consultant company</title><link>https://www.svorstol.com/blog/2021/02-14-team-top-at-capra/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Feb 2021 18:03:29 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.svorstol.com/blog/2021/02-14-team-top-at-capra/</guid><description>In the last year or so I have been involved in reorganizing the company where I work, Capra Consutling, based on the same prinicples as one would want to organize software development. In short, we had an organizations based on roles and hierarchies which made sense when we were no more than 50 employees.
