<h1 id=how-i-work-an-informational-manual>How I work, an informational manual</h1><p><em>Version 1.0</em>, (January 20, 2022)</p><p>Over the last couple of years, I&rsquo;ve seen people share &ldquo;instruction manuals&rdquo; for
themselves, shared through their personal websites. I recognize I&rsquo;d value this
instructional/informational overview for my own manager, so I might as well
provide that for those who I manage, work with and report to. <a href=https://www.remotecompany.com/blog/how-to-work-with-me-manual>This
article</a>
summarizes my motivations for doing this nicely, and a few of those that have
inspired me are <a href=https://github.com/hepwori/wwi/>Isaac Hepworth</a> and <a href=https://den.dev/how-i-work/>Den
Delimarsky</a>.</p><p>Please note, this is a continuous work in progress, as I learn and improve. If
it doesn’t make sense, or doesn’t fit with your experience of me, please reach
out.</p><h2 id=principles>Principles</h2><p>A couple of things I value and believe in:</p><ul>
<li>Making everyone heard and trusted - people are quite knowledgeable, and will give great input. With trust, we great even better results.</li><li>Taking action - stop discussing, let&rsquo;s try something out, get data or just go ahead and do it</li><li>Building multi-disciplinary teams - most problems are not one sided, i.e. cannot in full be solved by an area of expertise. Neither is one person alone the best way to handle problems or workloads.</li></ul><h2 id=work-schedule>Work Schedule</h2><p>I usually work from around 8-9 to 16-17. A few days a week I might work longer
or get a few more hours in later in the evening. This might mean that you&rsquo;ll
receive messages or emails from me outside working hours. This does not mean I
expect an answer. You&rsquo;ll answer when you have time. If it&rsquo;s urgent, I&rsquo;ll call.
It&rsquo;s almost never that urgent.</p><h2 id=communication>Communication</h2><p>I prefer asynchronous communication via Slack, or the messaging tool preferred
where we work, over tools such as emails. I do not expect instant replies, even
during the regular workday. I like when my team uses open team Slack-channels to
ask questions, or talk about ideas, because I believe it empowers the whole
team.</p><p><a href=https://blog.doist.com/inbox-zero/>Inbox Zero</a> is great, and I follow it. But, most emails are not urgent, so I do not handle it as such. If you need a fast answer, call instead of e-mailing. Or call me after the email is sent. To me, an email can wait to be answered for two days. If not, one should tell the recipient about the urgency.</p><p>To me, discussions fit better in Slack or a meeting, rather than email. Usually we have discussions over a particular decisions. It&rsquo;s easier to have these discussions if we write out the alternatives, the arguments for each of them, beforehand. This helps us get to the details, and where we disagree, faster.</p><h3 id=meetings>Meetings</h3><p>When calling for a meeting, I try to be clear on:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>The goal of the meeting</p></li><li>
<p>What the ideal result of the meeting would be</p></li><li>
<p>An agenda, preferably with some time boxing</p></li></ul><p>I love when the people I work with follow the same format, as I believe it makes
it easier to work and deliver value together.</p><p>It&rsquo;s worth mentioning that I appreciate that some meetings need to be more ad
hoc, and not as planned. It&rsquo;s nice to be clear on that need as well. This is
crucial in these times of hybrid work.</p><h3 id=feedback>Feedback</h3><p>Feedback is highly appreciated. I love to continuously improve. It’s nice to
know what I’m doing well, but it’s even better when I’m told what to do
differently.</p><h2 id=other-notes>Other notes</h2><ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t hesitate to reach out if you&rsquo;re blocked, or something&rsquo;s bothering you</li><li>I enjoy to read, and discuss it. It&rsquo;s nice to get inspired by others experiences, and see if one can use something from them. To get the time for reading, and trying things out, <a href=https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/time-blocking>I book time in my calendar</a>. The same goes for setting aside time to work on specific tasks.</li><li>During vacations I am usually literally offline, i.e. I&rsquo;m in the mountains with no coverage</li><li>I find the <a href=https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/eisenhower-matrix>The Eisenhower matrix</a>, and the <a href=https://miro.com/templates/impact-effort-matrix/>Impact/Effort-matrix </a> useful, and might refer to them a few times.</li></ul></content>
